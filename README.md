## ℹ️ About the project
- We were asked to develop an application that implements an address book to manage telephone and/or e-mail contacts.
- The project must be developed in Java, using the Apache Maven build automation tool, and the JavaFX library for developing the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Everything must be well documented, including all the specifications and diagrams that were studied during the theory module of the course.
- The project must also include appropriate test cases that the program must be able to pass, in order to guarantee correct operation during use.
