## ⚠️ Before you try!
This program handles two types of Contacts (`Contact` and `ExtendedContact`, which contain a bit more attributes that we do not export to vCard format).\
If you want to try the automatic loading of the save file that the program creates and on which writes automatically, follow these steps:
- Go to your home folder
  - `C:\Users\<your username>\` in Windows,
  - `/home/<your username>/` in Linux,
  - `/Users/<your username>/` in macOS
- Create a folder called "G12-Rubrica"
- Copy the file `BACKUP-TEST.bin` that you find in the root of this repository to the folder you just created
- Rename the file to `G12-Rubrica-savefile.bin`
- You are ready!

## ℹ️ About the project
- We were asked to develop an application that implements an address book to manage telephone and/or e-mail contacts.
- The project must be developed in Java, using the Apache Maven build automation tool, and the JavaFX library for developing the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Everything must be well documented, including all the specifications and diagrams that were studied during the theory module of the course.
- The project must also include appropriate test cases that the program must be able to pass, in order to guarantee correct operation during use.
